## Current State Assessment

### Strengths
✅ **Solid Foundation**: 17 entity types with consistent UI/UX
✅ **Characters System**: First-class entities with appearance analyzer
✅ **Testing Infrastructure**: 66 tests covering critical paths
✅ **Code Organization**: Entity configs split into manageable files
✅ **State Persistence**: Sidebar collapse state persists via localStorage
✅ **Keyboard Navigation**: Working smoothly with shortcuts modal
✅ **Job Queue**: Real-time tracking for background tasks
✅ **Multi-Provider LLM**: LiteLLM routing with Gemini/OpenAI
✅ **Lazy Loading**: Images load on-demand for performance

### Areas for Improvement
🔴 **Performance**: No pagination for large entity lists (200+ items)
🔴 **Frontend Coverage**: Only 1 component has tests (StoryPresetModal)
🟡 **Large Components**: Composer.jsx (910 lines), OutfitAnalyzer.jsx (702 lines) need refactoring
🟡 **Entity Operations**: No bulk select, no favorites/pinning, no duplication
🟡 **Local LLMs**: Cloud-only, no local model support yet
🟡 **Auth Tests**: 10 smoke tests pending auth fixture setup

## Development Principles

1. **Entity-First Design**: Always consider entity approach before adding features
2. **Performance by Default**: Pagination, lazy loading, memoization from start
3. **Keyboard-First UX**: Every common action should have a shortcut
4. **State Persistence**: Save user preferences and UI state
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work, optimizations enhance
6. **Code Organization**: Keep files small (<400 lines), extract shared logic
7. **Testing**: Manual test keyboard nav, bulk ops, edge cases

---

## Technical Debt to Address

### High Priority
1. **Entity Browser Performance**: No pagination for large lists (200+ entities)
2. **Large Components**: Composer.jsx (910 lines), OutfitAnalyzer.jsx (702 lines)
3. **Code Duplication**: OutfitAnalyzer + GenericAnalyzer are 85% duplicate (~500 lines)
4. **Auth Test Fixtures**: 10 smoke tests failing due to missing JWT fixtures

### Medium Priority
1. **Frontend Test Coverage**: Only StoryPresetModal has tests (~5% coverage)
2. **Error Handling**: More graceful error messages in entity operations
3. **Loading States**: Some operations lack loading indicators
4. **CSS Organization**: Some styles duplicated across components

### Low Priority
1. **Bundle Size**: Could optimize with code splitting
2. **API Caching**: Could add more aggressive caching
3. **Offline Support**: Could add service worker for offline use
4. **PropTypes/TypeScript**: No runtime type checking on components

---

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
🔴 **Performance Cliff**: No pagination - will hit performance wall at 200+ entities
🔴 **Maintainability**: Large components (Composer 910 lines) hard to modify safely
🟡 **Test Coverage**: Low frontend coverage means regressions likely
🟡 **Code Duplication**: OutfitAnalyzer/GenericAnalyzer duplication makes fixes error-prone

### Mitigations
- ⏳ Add pagination this week (prevents performance cliff)
- ⏳ Refactor large components with test coverage (prevents breakage)
- ✅ Testing infrastructure in place (can add tests incrementally)
- ✅ Entity configs split (completed)
- ✅ State persistence working (sidebar, browser state)
- Regular performance testing with large datasets
