# Job Queue System - Test Suite

Comprehensive test suite for verifying the job queue management system implementation.

## Test Components

### 1. Backend Python Tests (`test_job_queue_system.py`)

Automated Python test script that verifies:
- ‚úÖ API health and connectivity
- ‚úÖ Analyzer endpoints
- ‚úÖ Job management endpoints
- ‚úÖ Synchronous analysis workflow
- ‚úÖ Asynchronous analysis with job queue
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive analysis with selective analyzers
- ‚úÖ Job cancellation
- ‚úÖ Concurrent job execution

**Run the tests:**
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x tests/test_job_queue_system.py

# Run all tests
python3 tests/test_job_queue_system.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
==============================================================================
Job Queue System - Comprehensive Test Suite
==============================================================================

Testing: API Health Check
‚úì API is healthy

Testing: List Analyzers
‚úì Found 9 analyzers: outfit, comprehensive, visual-style, art-style, ...

... (more tests) ...

==============================================================================
Test Summary
==============================================================================
‚úì Passed: 8
‚úó Failed: 0
‚ö† Warnings: 0

Success Rate: 100.0%
```

### 2. Frontend Integration Tests (`test_frontend_integration.html`)

Interactive browser-based test page for manual verification of:
- üåê API connectivity from browser
- üìä Job queue operations
- üîÑ Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming
- üéØ Comprehensive analysis workflow

**Run the tests:**
```bash
# Open in browser (make sure Docker containers are running)
open tests/test_frontend_integration.html
# or
# Navigate to: file:///path/to/tests/test_frontend_integration.html
```

Click the test buttons to verify each feature. Results appear in real-time on the page.

## Prerequisites

Before running tests:

1. **Start Docker containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Verify services are running:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

   You should see:
   - `ai-studio-api` (running on port 8000)
   - `ai-studio-frontend` (running on port 80)

3. **Check API health:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

## Manual Testing Checklist

After running automated tests, manually verify the following in the browser:

### TaskManager UI

1. **Floating Button**
   - [ ] Button appears in bottom-right corner
   - [ ] Badge shows active job count
   - [ ] Button color changes based on job status (blue=running, green=completed, red=failed)
   - [ ] Button pulses when jobs are running

2. **Task Panel**
   - [ ] Panel slides in from bottom-right when button is clicked
   - [ ] Shows all active jobs
   - [ ] Jobs are grouped by status (Running ‚Üí Queued ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Failed)
   - [ ] Completed jobs auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

3. **Task Items**
   - [ ] Each task shows title, progress bar, and status icon
   - [ ] Running tasks show spinning icon and progress percentage
   - [ ] Progress bars animate smoothly
   - [ ] Cancel button works for running jobs
   - [ ] Dismiss button works for completed/failed jobs
   - [ ] Click to expand shows full details (error messages, results)

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - [ ] Task statuses update automatically via SSE
   - [ ] Progress bars update in real-time
   - [ ] New tasks appear immediately when created

### Analyzer Integration

1. **Individual Analyzers** (Outfit, Visual Style, etc.)
   - [ ] Upload image
   - [ ] Click "Analyze"
   - [ ] Modal closes immediately
   - [ ] Task appears in TaskManager
   - [ ] Progress updates in real-time
   - [ ] Task completes successfully
   - [ ] Preset is created in the list

2. **Comprehensive Analyzer**
   - [ ] Upload image
   - [ ] Select subset of analyses
   - [ ] Click "Run Selected Analyses"
   - [ ] Modal closes immediately
   - [ ] Parent task appears with child tasks
   - [ ] Each child task updates independently
   - [ ] Parent progress shows "X/Y complete"
   - [ ] All presets are created when complete

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail with Connection Error

**Problem:** `Connection refused` or `Failed to connect`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Restart containers
docker-compose restart

# Check API logs
docker-compose logs api
```

### SSE Tests Fail

**Problem:** `SSE connection error` or timeouts

**Solution:**
1. Check nginx configuration allows SSE:
   ```nginx
   proxy_buffering off;
   proxy_cache off;
   proxy_set_header Connection '';
   ```

2. Verify SSE endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -N http://localhost:8000/api/jobs/stream
   ```

### Jobs Never Complete

**Problem:** Jobs stuck in "running" or "queued" status

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check API logs for errors
docker-compose logs -f api

# Restart API container
docker-compose restart api
```

### Frontend Can't Connect to API

**Problem:** CORS errors or 404s

**Solution:**
1. Check nginx proxy configuration
2. Verify API is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance on standard hardware:

| Operation | Expected Time | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Single Analysis | 3-5 seconds | Depends on image size and model |
| Comprehensive (2 analyses) | 8-12 seconds | Runs analyzers sequentially |
| Comprehensive (6 analyses) | 20-30 seconds | Full analysis suite |
| Job Queue Overhead | <100ms | Job creation and queueing |
| SSE Latency | <500ms | Real-time update delivery |
| Concurrent Jobs (3) | ~Same as single | Jobs run in parallel |

## Continuous Testing

### Watch Mode for Development

Monitor API logs while testing:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f api
```

### Automated Testing in CI/CD

Add to your CI pipeline:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- name: Run Job Queue Tests
  run: |
    docker-compose up -d
    sleep 10  # Wait for services
    python3 tests/test_job_queue_system.py
    docker-compose down
```

## Test Data Cleanup

After testing, clean up test data:

```bash
# Remove test presets
rm -rf presets/outfits/*.json
rm -rf presets/visual_styles/*.json

# Remove test cache
rm -rf cache/*

# Remove preview images
rm -rf presets/*/*.png

# Restart containers to reset state
docker-compose restart
```

## Reporting Issues

If tests fail, include:
1. Test output (full log)
2. Docker logs: `docker-compose logs api`
3. Browser console errors (for frontend tests)
4. System info (OS, Docker version)
5. Test image used (if custom)

## Next Steps

After all tests pass:
1. ‚úÖ Test with real images
2. ‚úÖ Monitor performance under load
3. ‚úÖ Test concurrent user scenarios
4. ‚úÖ Verify cleanup and memory usage
5. ‚úÖ Test error recovery and edge cases
