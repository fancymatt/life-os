    "writing_principles": [
      "Dialogue should sound natural and distinct for each character",
      "Use subtext - what characters mean vs. what they say",
      "Interrupt narration with dialogue, don't interrupt dialogue with narration",
      "Action beats during dialogue show reaction and emotion",
      "Every line of dialogue should serve purpose: reveal character, advance plot, or create conflict",
      "Vary speech patterns - some people are direct, others ramble, some use humor"

    "dialogue_techniques": [
      "Use contractions and natural speech patterns",
      "People interrupt, trail off, change subjects",
      "What's NOT said can be as important as what is",
      "Arguments build - escalate realistically",
      "Humor and personality come through word choice",

      "closing": "End on a powerful line of dialogue or a reaction to dialogue."
    },

    "narration_guidelines": "Keep narrative brief. Use it for: necessary action, setting, character reactions (physical), and transitions. Don't explain what dialogue already conveys."
