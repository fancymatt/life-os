# Sprint 3: Composer Enhancements & UX Improvements

## Completed Features

### 1. Gallery with Comparison Mode âœ…
- Grid view of generated images
- Select up to 4 images for comparison
- Full-screen preview with download
- Auto-refresh from completed jobs

### 2. Favorites System âœ…
- Backend API (`/api/favorites/add`, `/api/favorites/remove`, `/api/favorites`)
- JSON file persistence per user
- Star button on preset thumbnails
- Integrated in both Composer and ModularGenerator
- Favorited presets sort to top of library

### 3. Preset Composer (Drag & Drop) âœ…
- Full-page three-column layout (Library | Canvas | Applied Stack)
- HTML5 drag-and-drop for presets
- Click-to-apply alternative (better for touch devices)
- Cumulative preset stacking:
  - Outfits can layer (multiple outfits combine)
  - Other categories replace (one hair color, one makeup, etc.)
- Smart caching system (same combination = cached result)
- Auto-generation on preset drop/removal
- Subtle corner loading indicator (keeps image visible)
- Integration with job queue system

### 4. Subject Image Selector âœ…
- Dedicated `/subjects/` directory for subject images
- Subject dropdown in canvas header
- Lists both default and uploaded subjects
- Updates cache when subject changes

### 5. Preset Search/Filtering âœ…
- Real-time search in preset library
- Filters by preset name or ID
- Maintains favorites-first sorting
- Clear search button for quick reset

### 6. Save/Load Preset Combinations âœ…
- Save current applied presets as named "composition"
- Collapsible saved compositions section in right panel
- Quick-load compositions with one click
- Delete compositions with confirmation
- Shows composition metadata (preset count, subject)
- Compositions persist per user in `/data/compositions/`

**Backend Implementation**:
- Created `/api/compositions` endpoints (save, list, get, delete)
- Compositions stored as JSON files in `data/compositions/{username}/`
- Includes timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

**Frontend Implementation**:
- Modal dialog for naming compositions
- Collapsible compositions list with toggle button
- Load (â†») and delete (Ã—) buttons for each composition
- Smooth animations for modal and list

### 7. Download Button for Generated Images âœ…
- Download button appears when image is generated
- Automatically generates descriptive filename with:
  - Subject name
  - Applied preset names
  - Timestamp
- Green badge positioned in bottom-right corner
- Smooth hover animations and feedback
- Client-side download (no server roundtrip)

### 8. Mobile Responsive Design âœ…
**Goal**: Make the Preset Composer fully usable on mobile phones without sacrificing desktop UX

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Desktop (â‰¥768px)**: Three-column grid layout (unchanged)
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Tab-based navigation with single-column layout

**Mobile Features**:
- Bottom tab navigation bar with 3 tabs:
  - ðŸ“š **Library**: Browse and search presets
  - ðŸŽ¨ **Canvas**: View and generate images
  - ðŸ“‹ **Applied**: Manage applied presets
- Active tab indicator with blue highlight
- Badge notifications:
  - Red badge on Applied tab showing preset count
  - Lightning badge on Canvas when generating
- Smart navigation:
  - Auto-switches to Canvas when applying presets
  - Auto-switches to Canvas when generating starts
- Touch-optimized:
  - 44px minimum touch targets (iOS guidelines)
  - Larger buttons and padding
  - Improved tap areas for all interactive elements
- Layout optimizations:
  - 2-column preset grid on mobile
  - 1-column on very small phones (<375px)
  - Full-width modals
  - Repositioned download button (above tabs)
  - Vertical subject selector
  - Reduced margins and padding where appropriate

**Responsive Breakpoints**:
- **Desktop**: â‰¥768px (three-column grid)
- **Tablet**: 768-1400px (narrower columns)
- **Mobile**: <768px (tab navigation)
- **Small phones**: <375px (single-column presets)

**CSS Architecture**:
- Mobile-first media queries
- Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop
- Conditional visibility based on screen size
- No JavaScript required for responsive layout (pure CSS)

## Planned Features (Future Sprints)

1. **Variation Count Control** (Priority: Low)
   - Slider to generate 1-4 variations at once
   - Show all variations in grid
   - Select favorite from variations

## Technical Notes

### Key Files Modified This Sprint
- `frontend/src/Composer.jsx` - Main composer component with all new features
- `frontend/src/Composer.css` - Full-page layout styling, compositions, modals
- `frontend/src/Gallery.jsx` - Image gallery with comparison
- `frontend/nginx.conf` - **CRITICAL**: Proxy `/output/`, `/uploads/`, `/subjects/` to API
- `api/routes/favorites.py` - Favorites endpoints
- `api/routes/compositions.py` - **NEW**: Compositions save/load endpoints
- `api/routes/analyzers.py` - Updated subject path resolution
- `api/routes/generators.py` - Updated subject path resolution for subjects directory
- `api/main.py` - Added compositions router, subjects static files
- `api/config.py` - Added subjects_dir configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added subjects volume mount

### Important Patterns
- **Outfit layering**: Check `preset.category === 'outfits'` to allow stacking
- **Cache keys**: `${subject}|${sorted_preset_ids}` format
- **Image URLs**: Must start with `/` for nginx proxying
- **Job polling**: 2-second intervals, 60 max attempts (2 minutes)

### Common Issues Solved
1. **Missing leading slash in image URLs** - Fixed in `pollForCompletion()`
2. **Nginx not proxying static files** - Added `/output/` and `/uploads/` locations
3. **Import errors in favorites** - Use `api.dependencies.auth` not `api.services.auth_service`

## Image Generation Strategy

We use a hybrid approach optimized for each use case:

### Preview Thumbnails (Pure Text-to-Image)
- **Model**: DALL-E 3
- **Use case**: Generating standalone preset preview images
- **Why**: Pure text-to-image with no source subject
- **Limitation**: 4000 character prompt limit (we truncate if needed)

### Modular Generator (Subject Transformation)
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Use case**: Applying presets to subject photos (main generation)
- **Why**: Requires source image, excels at image transformation
- **Advantage**: No prompt length limits, better subject preservation

This approach uses each model's strengths - DALL-E for creation, Gemini for transformation.
