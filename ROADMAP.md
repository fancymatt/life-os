## Overview

Life-OS is evolving from a specialized **AI image generation platform** into a **comprehensive personal AI assistant**. This roadmap consolidates all future development plans into clear, actionable phases.

**Current State** (October 2025):
- ✅ 17 entity types with consistent UI
- ✅ 8 image analyzers + 6 generators
- ✅ Story generation workflow
- ✅ Characters system with appearance analyzer
- ✅ Testing infrastructure (66 tests, smoke tests passing)
- ✅ Mobile responsive design

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Critical Fixes (4-6 weeks)

**Goal**: Stable, scalable foundation with proper data layer and performance

### 1.1 Database Migration (CRITICAL - 2-3 weeks)

**Current Problem**: All data stored as JSON files
- Does not scale beyond ~1000 entities per type
- Race conditions with concurrent writes
- No ACID guarantees, no full-text search, no efficient filtering

**Solution**: PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy async ORM

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create SQLAlchemy models for all entities
- [ ] Add Alembic for migrations
- [ ] Migration script to import existing JSON data
- [ ] Update service layer to use async ORM queries
- [ ] Add database connection pooling
- [ ] Update tests to use in-memory SQLite

**Impact**: 10-100x faster queries, enables pagination, full-text search, relational queries

---

### 1.2 Performance Optimizations (1-2 weeks)

**Backend Pagination**:
- [ ] Add limit/offset to all list endpoints
- [ ] Return total count with paginated results
- [ ] Standard pagination params (50 items per page)

**Response Caching**:
- [ ] Add Redis-based caching for read endpoints
- [ ] Cache TTL: 60 seconds for lists, 5 minutes for details
- [ ] Cache invalidation on write operations

**Virtual Scrolling** (Frontend):
- [ ] Use react-window for entity lists (200+ items)
- [ ] Only render visible items
- [ ] Smooth scrolling with 1000+ entities

**Success Criteria**:
- Lists of 500+ entities load in <500ms
- Paginated responses in <300ms
- No memory leaks with large datasets

---

### 1.3 Code Quality Improvements (1 week)

**Logging Infrastructure**:
- [ ] Replace all `print()` with proper logging
- [ ] Structured JSON logs with request IDs
- [ ] Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
- [ ] Correlation IDs for request tracing

**Error Handling Standardization**:
- [ ] Create standardized error response models
- [ ] Error codes for programmatic handling
- [ ] Consistent error format across all endpoints
- [ ] Global error handler middleware

**Component Refactoring**:
- [ ] Split Composer.jsx (910 lines → ~300 lines + subcomponents)
- [ ] Unify OutfitAnalyzer + GenericAnalyzer (eliminate ~500 line duplication)
- [ ] Create shared component library (Modal, FormField, LoadingSpinner)

**Success Criteria**:
- No component over 500 lines
- Zero print() statements in production code
- Consistent error responses across all endpoints

---

### 1.4 Testing Expansion (Ongoing)

**Backend**:
- [ ] Fix 10 failing smoke tests (add auth fixtures)
- [ ] Integration tests for new features (story presets, tool configs)
- [ ] Target: 80% coverage for service layer

**Frontend**:
- [ ] EntityBrowser component tests
- [ ] Character import flow tests
- [ ] Critical path coverage: story workflow, image generation
- [ ] Target: 40% coverage

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk 🔴
1. **Database Migration Complexity**: 2-3 weeks of careful migration work
   - Mitigation: Test thoroughly in dev, backup all data, gradual rollout

2. **BGG API Stability**: Rate limits, blocking, changes
   - Mitigation: Aggressive caching, manual upload fallback, respect limits

3. **LLM Hallucination in Q&A**: Wrong citations, fabricated answers
   - Mitigation: Strict prompts, confidence scores, user feedback, verification warnings

### Medium Risk 🟡
1. **Performance at Scale**: Unknown limits with large datasets
   - Mitigation: Pagination, virtual scrolling, load testing

2. **Local LLM Quality**: May not match cloud models
   - Mitigation: User choice, clear expectations, cloud fallback

3. **Plugin System Complexity**: Hard to get abstraction right
   - Mitigation: Start simple, iterate based on real plugins

---

## Long-Term Vision (12-18 months)

**Life-OS as Comprehensive AI Assistant**:
- 20+ entity types across multiple domains
- 50+ standalone tools, all frontend-configurable
- Hybrid cloud + local LLM architecture
- Plugin ecosystem for extensions
- Semi-autonomous agents for routine tasks
- Cross-domain intelligence and context

**User Experience**:
- Create once, use everywhere (characters, styles, workflows)
- Everything keyboard-accessible
- Fast and responsive (feels local-first)
- Intelligent and learns preferences
- Powerful bulk operations
- Beautiful and intuitive UI

---

## Design Principles (Maintained Throughout)

1. **Entity-First Design**: Always consider entity approach before adding features
2. **Modularity Over Monoliths**: Discrete fields, not large text blobs
3. **Configuration Over Code**: Editable prompts, models, parameters
4. **User Agency**: Manual triggers, editable results, transparency
5. **Performance by Default**: Pagination, lazy loading, caching from start
6. **Testing First**: Write tests for new features, fix failing tests immediately
7. **State Persistence**: Save user preferences and UI state
8. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work, optimizations enhance

---

## Key Architecture Decisions

**Why Database (Phase 1.1)?**
- Enables scaling to 10,000+ entities
- Full-text search without reading all files
- Proper indexing for fast filtering/sorting
- Transactions for data integrity
- Relational queries (find all stories with character X)

**Why Plugins (Phase 4)?**
- Domain-specific features without bloating core
- Community contributions possible
- Hot-reload during development
- Clear separation of concerns

**Why Local LLMs (Phase 3)?**
- Cost savings (no API fees)
- Privacy (sensitive data stays local)
- Offline capability
- Faster iteration during development

**Why Document Q&A (Phase 2)?**
- Validates RAG architecture for future features
- Solves real problem (rules questions during games)
- Foundation for teaching guides, FAQs, documentation
- Generic Q&A entity supports multiple contexts (documents, general, images)

## Notes

- **This roadmap supersedes**: DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, OPTIMIZATION_ROADMAP.md, ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md, BOARD_GAME_TOOLS.md
- **Keep as reference**: DESIGN_PATTERNS.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md
- **Historical**: SPRINT_3.md (completed features)

**Next Update**: After completing Phase 1 (Foundation), reassess priorities and timelines.
