---

#### Entity Merge Tool
**Priority**: HIGH
**Complexity**: High (1 week)
**Status**: Planned
**Phase**: 2

AI-assisted merging of similar entities with reference migration.

**Workflow**:
1. User selects Entity A (keep) and Entity B (merge into A)

- "Find Similar" based on embedding distance
- Simple aesthetic heuristics (color harmony, composition balance, contrast)
- Taste-based ranking for sweeps and suggestions

**Data Sources**:
- Favorites (explicit positive signal)
- Tags applied by user (categorization preferences)
- Accepted vs rejected outputs (implicit feedback)

Structured exploration instead of ad-hoc retries: batch sweeps across controllable axes.

**Concept**:
- Generate variants along multiple axes (palette, lighting, angle, style intensity)
- Auto-rank with aesthetic heuristics + LLM rubric
- Browse as "branches" you can prune and promote

**Example Workflow**:
1. User selects base image/prompt
2. Choose exploration axes:
   - Palette: warm/cool/vibrant/muted
   - Lighting: soft/dramatic/natural/studio
   - Angle: front/side/three-quarter/overhead
   - Style intensity: subtle/moderate/extreme
3. Generate grid of variants (2-4 per axis = 16-64 images)
4. Auto-rank by:
   - Composition balance (rule of thirds, golden ratio)
   - Color harmony (complementary, analogous, triadic)
   - Contrast and readability
   - LLM rubric: "Rate aesthetic quality 1-10, explain reasoning"
   - TasteProfile similarity to user's favorites
5. Present as tree view: prune weak branches, promote winners
6. Winners become new base for next iteration

**UI**:
- Tree/grid toggle view
- Filter by rank threshold
- Quick compare mode (side-by-side)
- One-click "explore this branch deeper"

**Cost Control**:
- Batch generation API calls (cheaper)

## Architectural Principles

1. **Infrastructure Before Features**: Build solid foundations first
2. **Policy Before Autonomy**: No agent action without policy approval
3. **Propose Before Act**: Surface cards in Brief, get user approval
4. **Provenance Always**: Full lineage for reproducibility
5. **Taste as Foundation**: TasteProfile influences everything
6. **Reversible Actions**: Auto-Tidy and Autopilot can be undone
7. **Privacy by Default**: Personal connectors opt-in only
8. **Cost Awareness**: Track and optimize every dollar spent

---

- What's the card ranking algorithm?
- How to handle Brief on weekends/vacation?

**Auto-Prep**:
- How to detect "successful" vs "failed" prep?
- What's the feedback loop for improvement?
- How to handle conflicting policies (spend cap vs prepare 5 packs)?

**Policy System**:
- How granular should policies be?
- How to override policy in emergencies?
- How to version policies without breaking agents?

**MCP Integration**:
- Which MCP tools to expose first?
- How to handle MCP endpoint failures?
