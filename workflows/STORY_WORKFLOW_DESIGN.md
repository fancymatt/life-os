# Story Generation Workflow - Design Document

**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: ðŸš§ Prototype Phase
**Purpose**: Validate workflow orchestration architecture for Phase 2

---

## Overview

The Story Generation Workflow is a **multi-agent workflow prototype** that creates illustrated stories involving characters. This serves as a test case for the workflow orchestration system planned in Phase 2.

### Workflow Steps

```
1. Story Planner Agent
   â”œâ”€ Input: Character, theme, target length
   â”œâ”€ Process: Generate story outline with scenes
   â””â”€ Output: Story outline (JSON)
         â†“
2. Story Writer Agent
   â”œâ”€ Input: Story outline, prose style
   â”œâ”€ Process: Write full story with scene descriptions
   â””â”€ Output: Complete story with scene markers
         â†“
3. Image Illustrator (existing modular generator)
   â”œâ”€ Input: Scene descriptions, character details
   â”œâ”€ Process: Generate images for key scenes
   â””â”€ Output: Illustrated story (text + images)
```

## Architecture

### Workflow Engine (Minimal Implementation)

For this prototype, we'll create a **simplified workflow engine** that:
- Executes steps sequentially
- Passes data between steps
- Handles errors gracefully
- Tracks progress

**File**: `api/core/simple_workflow.py`

```python
class WorkflowStep:
    step_id: str
    execute: Callable  # Function to run
    inputs: List[str]  # Input variable names
    outputs: List[str] # Output variable names

class SimpleWorkflow:
    steps: List[WorkflowStep]
    context: Dict[str, Any]  # Shared data between steps

    async def execute():
        for step in steps:
            result = await step.execute(context)
            context.update(result)
```

### Agent Interface (Minimal Implementation)

**File**: `api/core/simple_agent.py`

```python
class Agent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, input_data: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Execute agent task"""
        pass

    def get_config(self) -> Dict:
        """Return agent configuration"""
        pass
```

## Component Design

### 1. Story Planner Agent

**File**: `api/agents/story_planner.py`

**Input Schema**:
```json
{
  "character": {
    "name": "string",
    "appearance": "string (optional)",
    "personality": "string (optional)"
  },
  "theme": "string (e.g., 'adventure', 'mystery', 'friendship')",
  "target_scenes": "int (default: 5)",
  "age_group": "string (e.g., 'children', 'young_adult', 'adult')"
}
```

**Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "outline": [
    {
      "scene_number": 1,
      "title": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "action": "string",
      "illustration_prompt": "string (for image generation)",
      "estimated_words": 150
    }
  ],
  "total_estimated_words": 750
}
```

**Implementation**:
- Uses LLM (Gemini/OpenAI) to generate structured outline
- Ensures logical story flow
- Creates illustration prompts for each scene
- Can be parameterized with theme, tone, complexity

---

### 2. Story Writer Agent

**File**: `api/agents/story_writer.py`

**Input Schema**:
```json
{
  "outline": "StoryOutline (from planner)",
  "prose_style": "string (e.g., 'descriptive', 'concise', 'poetic')",
  "perspective": "string (e.g., 'first_person', 'third_person')",
  "tense": "string (e.g., 'past', 'present')"
}
```

**Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "story": "string (full text)",
  "scenes": [
    {
      "scene_number": 1,
      "text": "string (scene text)",
      "illustration_prompt": "string"
    }
  ],
  "word_count": 823,
  "metadata": {
    "prose_style": "descriptive",
    "perspective": "third_person",
    "generated_at": "ISO datetime"
  }
}
```

**Implementation**:
- Expands each scene from outline
- Maintains character consistency
- Applies prose style
- Includes scene markers for illustration

### 3. Image Illustrator (Wrapper for Existing Tools)

**File**: `api/agents/story_illustrator.py`

**Input Schema**:
```json
{
  "story": "WrittenStory (from writer)",
  "character_appearance": "string (visual description)",
  "art_style": "string (e.g., 'watercolor', 'digital_art', 'sketch')",
  "max_illustrations": "int (default: 5)"
}
```

**Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "story": "string",
  "illustrations": [
    {
      "scene_number": 1,
      "image_url": "string",
      "prompt_used": "string",
      "generation_time": "float"
    }
  ],
  "total_generation_time": 45.2
}
```

**Implementation**:
- Uses existing `modular_image_generator`
- Generates consistent character across scenes
- Applies art style
- Can use subject image if provided

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each agent independently
- Mock LLM responses
- Verify output schemas

### Integration Tests
- Test workflow execution end-to-end
- Test error handling (what if writer fails?)
- Test parameter variations

### Manual Tests
- Generate stories with different themes
- Try different prose styles
- Evaluate illustration quality
- Test edge cases (very short/long stories)

---

## Success Criteria

### Functional
- âœ… Workflow executes all 3 steps successfully
- âœ… Story has coherent beginning, middle, end
- âœ… Illustrations match scene descriptions
- âœ… Character consistency across scenes
- âœ… Parameterization works (theme, style, etc.)

### Technical
- âœ… Identifies architectural needs for Phase 2
- âœ… Demonstrates workflow orchestration patterns
- âœ… Tests agent communication
- âœ… Validates error handling approach
- âœ… Measures performance (total execution time)

### Architectural Insights
- Document what works well
- Document pain points
- Identify missing capabilities
- Suggest improvements for Phase 2

## Learnings to Document

After building this prototype, document:

1. **What worked well**:
   - Which patterns were easy to implement?
   - What felt natural?
   - What would scale well?

2. **Pain points**:
   - What was clunky or awkward?
   - What required workarounds?
   - What would break at scale?

3. **Missing capabilities**:
   - What features are needed for Phase 2?
   - What abstractions are missing?
   - What would improve developer experience?

4. **Performance observations**:
   - Bottlenecks?
   - Opportunities for parallelization?
   - Resource usage?

## Future Enhancements (Post-Prototype)

### Phase 2 Workflow Engine
- Parallel step execution
- Conditional branching (if/else)
- Loops (generate N variations)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Workflow templates
- Visual workflow builder (UI)

### Enhanced Agents
- Multi-modal agents (text + image input)
- Agent collaboration (agents asking each other for help)
- Agent learning (improve from user feedback)
- Agent specialization (agents for specific genres)

### Advanced Features
- Story variations (generate 3 different endings)
- Interactive stories (user chooses path)
- Story editing (regenerate specific scenes)
- Export formats (PDF, ePub, video)
- Voice narration (text-to-speech)

## Notes for Phase 2 Architecture

Based on this prototype, Phase 2 should include:

1. **Plugin System**: Story agents should be plugins
2. **Workflow DSL**: JSON definition is good, but needs validation
3. **Context Management**: Agents need shared context (character details, etc.)
4. **Error Recovery**: Workflows need retry/fallback strategies
5. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates essential
6. **Cost Tracking**: Track LLM costs per workflow
7. **Caching**: Cache outlines, avoid regenerating entire stories
8. **Streaming**: Stream story text as it's generated
9. **Collaborative Editing**: User edits outline â†’ regenerate story
10. **Permissions**: Some workflows may need approval (e.g., publishing)

## Example Output

**Input**:
```json
{
  "character": {"name": "Zara", "appearance": "astronaut", "personality": "determined"},
  "theme": "space exploration",
  "target_scenes": 5,
  "prose_style": "cinematic"
}
```

**Output** (abbreviated):
```
Title: Zara's Cosmic Discovery

Scene 1: The Mission Briefing
[Illustration: Zara in mission control room]
Zara stood before the holographic star map, her reflection ghosting across
the swirling galaxies. Tomorrow, she would pilot the Exodus One further
than any human had ventured...

Scene 2: Launch
[Illustration: Rocket launching into space]
The countdown echoed through her helmet. Three. Two. One. The world
transformed into a blur of sound and fury as thousands of tons of thrust
pushed her toward the stars...

[... 3 more scenes ...]

Total generation time: 73.4 seconds
Word count: 1,247
Illustrations: 5
```
