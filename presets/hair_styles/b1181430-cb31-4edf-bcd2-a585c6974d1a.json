  "cut": "This style features a long, layered cut designed to maintain significant length while incorporating movement and dimension. The perimeter is kept very long, extending well past the waist, with a slightly tapered end shape rather than a blunt line. The cut incorporates vertical layering to reduce bulk and allow for easier styling into voluminous pigtails without excessive heaviness. The interior is textured with point-cutting to create movement while maintaining the density needed for the voluminous pigtail silhouette.",
  "length": "Very long",
  "layers": "The hair features substantial layering throughout with a heavy graduation that removes significant weight from the interior while preserving length at the perimeter. Layers are distributed from the crown down with high elevation techniques, creating lift and body at the roots while allowing longer lengths to flow and move. The graduation is quite pronounced with several inches of difference between the shortest crown layers and the longest perimeter lengths. This extensive layering structure enables the dramatic volume and movement seen in the styled pigtails, preventing the hair from appearing flat or heavy despite its considerable length.",
  "texture": "The hair displays a naturally straight base texture that has been meticulously styled to achieve a perfectly sleek, glass-like finish with high shine. The strands are completely smooth and aligned, showing evidence of thorough blow-drying with a paddle brush followed by flat-iron passes to seal the cuticle and eliminate any texture or wave. There is no frizz, flyaway hairs, or piece-y separation visible - every strand flows in the same direction creating a unified, polished appearance. The finish is distinctly glossy and reflective, indicating the use of shine serums and smoothing products applied during the styling process.",
  "volume": "Full and voluminous throughout",
  "parting": "No visible part/swept back",
  "front_styling": "The front is styled without bangs, maintaining a clean, swept-back approach that keeps the forehead completely clear. The hairline is pulled back smoothly into the high pigtails without any face-framing pieces or shorter layers left out around the face. The front sections are secured tightly to create a sleek, polished look at the hairline with no soft or wispy pieces.",
  "overall_style": "This is a high fashion interpretation of anime-style twin pigtails, featuring two dramatically positioned ponytails secured at the upper crown area with significant height and outward projection. The style references Japanese animation and cosplay culture while being executed with salon-quality precision and polish. The pigtails are positioned symmetrically with substantial volume and length, creating an exaggerated, playful silhouette that makes a bold style statement.",
