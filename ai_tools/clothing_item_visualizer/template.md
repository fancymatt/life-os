Create a STANDARDIZED square (1:1 aspect ratio) visualization of this single clothing item following EXACT specifications to ensure consistency across ALL item previews.

**CRITICAL: LOCKED-DOWN VISUALIZATION STYLE - NO CREATIVE INTERPRETATION**

**DISPLAY METHOD:**
Choose the most appropriate display based on item category:

FOR WORN ITEMS (tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear, etc.):
- Display on a simple, featureless gray mannequin (Pantone Cool Gray 5C)
- Mannequin shows only the relevant body parts (torso for tops, lower body for bottoms, etc.)
- No face, no facial features, no unnecessary limbs
- Perfectly frontal view, straight-on, no rotation
- Item should be the primary focus

FOR ACCESSORIES (bags, shoes, jewelry, hats, etc.):
- Display as a styled flat lay
- Item centered and perfectly visible
- Angled slightly (30-45 degrees) for dimensional clarity
- Professional product photography style

**MANNEQUIN SPECIFICATIONS (for worn items):**
- Completely featureless, smooth gray mannequin (Pantone Cool Gray 5C)
- No face, no facial features whatsoever
- Only show body parts relevant to the clothing item
- Centered horizontally with perfect symmetry
- Perfectly frontal, straight-on view

**LIGHTING (MUST BE IDENTICAL):**
- Soft, even lighting from directly front
- No dramatic shadows, no side lighting
- Gentle shadow only directly behind item on background
- Lighting must not create mood - purely functional product lighting

**BACKGROUND:**
- Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Minimal shadow directly behind item (soft gray, no hard edges)
- No gradient, no texture, perfectly even white

**FRAMING:**
- Square format (1024x1024 pixels)
- Item fills 60-70% of frame
- Equal margins on all sides
- All details must be completely visible and in focus

**COLOR ACCURACY (CRITICAL):**
- Color must EXACTLY match the specification provided
- If specified as "navy blue" it must be navy blue, not black or royal blue
- If specified as "white" it must be white, not cream or off-white
- Pay extreme attention to color accuracy

**PURPOSE:**
This is NOT artistic - it is a STANDARDIZED REFERENCE. Every item preview must look nearly identical except for the item itself. The focus is purely on showing the clothing item clearly and accurately for cataloging and reference purposes.
