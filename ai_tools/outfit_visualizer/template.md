Create a STANDARDIZED square (1:1 aspect ratio) visualization of this outfit following EXACT specifications to ensure consistency across ALL outfit previews.

**CRITICAL: LOCKED-DOWN VISUALIZATION STYLE - NO CREATIVE INTERPRETATION**

**MANNEQUIN SPECIFICATIONS (MUST BE IDENTICAL ACROSS ALL PREVIEWS):**
- Completely featureless, smooth gray mannequin (Pantone Cool Gray 5C)
- No face, no facial features whatsoever
- No neck detailing, smooth transitions
- Shoulders and torso only (no arms unless clothing requires them)
- If arms are needed: simple cylinders in same gray, positioned at sides
- Height in frame: mannequin shoulders start at 15% from top, torso ends at 75% from top
- Centered horizontally with perfect symmetry

**POSE (MUST BE IDENTICAL):**
- Perfectly frontal view, straight-on
- No rotation, no angle, completely flat-facing
- Shoulders level and parallel to top edge
- If full body: feet together, standing straight

**LIGHTING (MUST BE IDENTICAL):**
- Soft, even lighting from directly front
- No dramatic shadows, no side lighting
- Gentle shadow only directly behind mannequin on background
- Lighting must not create mood - purely functional product lighting

**BACKGROUND:**
- Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Minimal shadow directly behind mannequin (soft gray, no hard edges)
- No gradient, no texture, perfectly even white

**FRAMING:**
- Square format (1024x1024 pixels)
- Mannequin fills 70% of frame height
- Equal margins on all sides
- Clothing must be completely visible and in focus

**PURPOSE:**
This is NOT artistic - it is a STANDARDIZED REFERENCE. Every outfit preview must look nearly identical except for the clothing itself. A viewer should be able to overlay two different outfit previews and see only the clothing differences, with mannequin, pose, lighting, and background perfectly aligned.
