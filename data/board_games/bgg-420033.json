  "description": "Vantage is an open-world, co-operative, non-campaign adventure game that features an entire planet to explore, with&nbsp;players communicating while scattered across the world. With nearly eight hundred interconnected locations on four hundred cards and over nine hundred other discoverable cards, the world is your sandbox.&#10;&#10;You begin each game of Vantage on an intergalactic vessel heading towards an uncharted planet. After crashing far from your companions, you have complete freedom as to how you explore, discover, and interact with the planet. You view your location from a first-person perspective, and you can communicate with and support other players, but you are separated by vast distances, so only you can see your current location.&#10;&#10;In addition to a mission victory, a destiny victory, or an epic victory (completing both the mission and a destiny), you may define success in Vantage through anything you pursue and achieve.&#10;&#10;Vantage is not a campaign game. Each game is a standalone experience; you bring to future sessions only what you&rsquo;ve learned about the world. It is completely self-contained with no&nbsp;expansions &mdash; just a few accessories like metal coins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
